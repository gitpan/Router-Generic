  - When $router->match(...) has multiple matches, it will return a list or arrayref
    depending on the context in which it is called.
  - Updated POD.
  - Updated tests.
  - Removed the "non-MVC" bit because it could be used for MVC-ish stuff actually.

2010-03-24    v0.006
  - If passed an arrayref of targets, match(...) will return an arrayref of targets.
    (This is useful when you want one as the default, and the other as the fallback.)

2010-03-23    v0.005
  - Route-matching when the route is declared with method '*' and matched with
    'GET' or 'POST' explicitly would fail.  This is now fixed.

2010-03-23    v0.004
  - Added 'method' parameter to add_route() and match() methods.
  - 'method' defaults to '*' - so you can safely ignore it if you would rather.
  - Added more tests to account for the extra features.
  - Added basic CRUD example in POD.

2010-03-22    v0.003
  - Forgot to update Changes file.

2010-03-22    v0.002
  - Renamed from Router::Lite to Router::Generic.
  - Added uri_for(...) method.
  - Added many tests.  Code-coverage is fairly high.
  - Route path grammar is 99.99% final.  Any future changes will be backwards-compatible.
  - Speed is acceptable, even with large routing tables.

2010-03-20    v0.001_01
  - Alpha level - Still under development.
  - Handles some path declarations and allows specification of default values.
  - Returns 'match()' results as a parameterized string.
  - Supports simple route caching.
